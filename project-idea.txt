What we're trying to solve:
Disparities in healthcare caused by lack of knowledge of health conditions, lack of access to PCPs
and other healthcare providers, untimely scheduling of appointments.

How we're going to do it:
Use Twilio API to send texts/calls to PCPs, use Microsoft Azure for something
